//I told him and to sick it Out of town with a dime to my name Said I'm done with all my fake friends Self-righteous pawns in a losing game Got my bedroom right then woke you out Been a burden since the day I was born So I cried just little then I dried my eyes 'Cause I'm not a little girl no more Some of us have to grow up sometimes And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind Some of us have to grow up sometimes And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind Certain life is so long as the picket Something I will never understand I'm too tired of always being mad at the world Won't you just admit you don't care Lady I don't want your pity So don't feel sorry for me I've got a lover would die for this song to sing Maybe we're both just living out how I dream
